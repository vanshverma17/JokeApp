# JokeApp

This is a web app that I made while i was learning to use public APIs. In this I used JokeAPI to fetch the jokes. I used express.js and node.js for backend. page is rendered in ejs file so that the data fetched from the API can be rendered into the website.

How to start the WebApp : 
1. Download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. run the "npm i" command to install all the dependencies.
3. run the "nodemon index.js" command to start the server.
4. On your browser type the link "http://localhost:3000/".
